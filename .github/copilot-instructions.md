## Project Overview
This is a modern, responsive landing page for CodeNext, a software development company specializing in web and mobile applications with enterprise-grade quality and security standards.

## Code Style Guidelines

### CSS
- Use CSS custom properties (CSS variables) defined in `:root`
- Follow BEM methodology for class naming when applicable
- Use CSS Grid and Flexbox for layouts
- Implement mobile-first responsive design
- Use CSS animations and transitions for smooth user experiences
- Maintain consistent spacing using the predefined spacing variables

### JavaScript
- Use modern ES6+ syntax
- Implement proper error handling
- Use semantic function and variable names
- Follow functional programming principles when possible
- Optimize performance with throttling and debouncing for scroll events
- Use Intersection Observer API for animations and lazy loading

### HTML
- Use semantic HTML5 elements
- Ensure proper accessibility with ARIA attributes
- Include meta tags for SEO optimization
- Use proper heading hierarchy (h1, h2, h3, etc.)
- Add alt attributes for all images

## Key Features to Maintain
1. **Responsive Design**: Ensure all components work on mobile, tablet, and desktop
2. **Smooth Animations**: Use CSS transforms and opacity for performance
3. **Interactive Carousel**: Maintain touch support and keyboard navigation
4. **Form Validation**: Provide real-time validation feedback
5. **SEO Optimization**: Keep semantic structure and meta tags updated

## Brand Guidelines
- Primary color: #1E88E5 (Blue)
- Secondary color: #7C4DFF (Purple) 
- Accent color: #FF6B35 (Orange)
- Font family: Inter
- Maintain professional, modern aesthetic
- Use gradients for visual appeal

## Performance Considerations
- Optimize images and use appropriate formats
- Minimize CSS and JavaScript for production
- Use lazy loading for images
- Implement smooth scrolling with `scroll-behavior: smooth`
- Use CSS `transform` and `opacity` for animations (GPU acceleration)

## Accessibility Requirements
- Maintain keyboard navigation support
- Ensure sufficient color contrast ratios
- Provide focus indicators for interactive elements
- Use proper ARIA labels and roles
- Support screen readers with semantic markup

When making changes or additions, ensure they align with the existing design system and maintain the professional, modern aesthetic of the CodeNext brand.
